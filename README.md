# UkraineReport
#### Video Demo:  
#### Description:
UkraineReport is a map application, that allows civilians to quickly share geolocational data on injured people or who might need medical aid. Users can anonymously add markers with location, add title and description, as well as severity of the injury. Depending on this severity, markers are of different colour. You can also share your location and the app will show you on map. You can also check satellite view and search by location.
Markers only stay in the database for 3 days, then they are deleted. This means that the officials don't need to delete reports, but because of this feature I also made it possible to search by latest reports.
